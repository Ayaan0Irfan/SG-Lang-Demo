AI/ML Technical Guide

=== Large Language Models (LLMs) ===

Large Language Models are neural networks with billions of parameters trained on vast amounts of text data. Popular models include:

- GPT-4: OpenAI's flagship model with 1.76 trillion parameters, excellent for reasoning and code generation
- Llama 3.1: Meta's open-source model available in 8B, 70B, and 405B parameter variants
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet: Anthropic's model known for safety and helpfulness
- Gemini Pro: Google's multimodal model supporting text, images, and code

LLMs work through transformer architecture, using attention mechanisms to understand context and generate coherent responses.

=== Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) ===

RAG combines information retrieval with language generation to reduce hallucinations and provide up-to-date information. The RAG pipeline consists of:

1. Document Ingestion: Converting documents into embeddings using models like sentence-transformers
2. Vector Storage: Storing embeddings in vector databases (Faiss, Pinecone, Weaviate)
3. Retrieval: Finding relevant documents using semantic similarity search
4. Augmentation: Adding retrieved context to the user query
5. Generation: Using LLM to generate response based on query + context

Benefits of RAG:
- Reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in factual data
- Enables real-time information updates without model retraining
- Allows fine-grained control over knowledge sources
- Cost-effective compared to fine-tuning large models

=== Vector Databases and Embeddings ===

Vector databases store high-dimensional embeddings and enable fast similarity search:

Faiss (Facebook AI Similarity Search):
- Developed by Meta for billion-scale vector search
- Supports CPU and GPU acceleration
- Multiple index types: IndexFlatIP, IndexHNSW, IndexIVF
- Excellent for local development and research

Pinecone:
- Managed vector database service
- Built-in filtering and metadata support
- Auto-scaling and high availability
- Best for production applications

Weaviate:
- Open-source vector database with GraphQL API
- Built-in ML models and text processing
- Hybrid search combining vector and keyword search
- Good for complex data relationships

Embedding Models:
- sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2: Fast, lightweight, good general performance
- text-embedding-ada-002: OpenAI's embedding model, high quality but requires API calls
- BGE models: State-of-the-art open-source embeddings from Beijing Academy of AI

=== SGLang (Structured Generation Language) ===

SGLang is a programming language designed for complex LLM workflows:

Key Features:
- Structured prompting with branching logic
- Parallel execution of multiple LLM calls
- Built-in retry mechanisms and error handling
- Integration with popular LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)

Example SGLang program:
```
@function
def analyze_document(document):
    summary = llm("Summarize this document:", document)
    keywords = llm("Extract 5 key terms:", document)
    sentiment = llm("What is the sentiment?", document)
    return {"summary": summary, "keywords": keywords, "sentiment": sentiment}
```

Benefits over naive prompting:
- 3-5x faster execution through parallelization
- Better error handling and retries
- Structured outputs and type safety
- Easier debugging and testing

=== Performance Optimization ===

Best practices for production RAG systems:

1. Chunk Size Optimization:
   - Technical docs: 200-400 tokens
   - Narrative text: 400-800 tokens
   - Code: Function or class level chunks

2. Retrieval Tuning:
   - Use hybrid search (vector + keyword)
   - Implement re-ranking for better relevance
   - Optimize top-k retrieval (typically 3-10 documents)

3. Caching Strategies:
   - Cache embeddings to avoid recomputation
   - Cache LLM responses for repeated queries
   - Use async processing for better throughput

4. Model Selection:
   - Fast models (Groq, local inference) for development
   - High-quality models (GPT-4, Claude) for production
   - Consider cost vs. quality tradeoffs
